Coding Exercise

Create a simple "Library" webapp using html, js, and jquery that allows a user to manage a list of books.

Requirements

	all books should have values for "title" and "author" and stored in an array.
	there should be functions for adding and removing a book from the library (ui and array).
	the user interface should include the following:
	current listing of all the books in the library.
	"Add Book" button that when clicked displays the "Add Book Form"
	"Add Book Form" should include text fields for the "title" and "author" attributes of a book field.
	"Add Book Form" should include a "Done" button that when clicked validates that values for "title" and "author" have 
		been provided. If these values are not entered an error message is displayed to the user. If these values are entered 
		then the "Book" is added to the "library" and the list on the ui is updated.
	There should be a way for the user to remove a book either with "x" or garbage can icon that when clicked 
		removes the book from the "library" and the UI.
		
When done, zip up your project and email it to Freddy.
